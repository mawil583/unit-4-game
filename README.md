Star Wars Role Playing Game

https://mawil583.github.io/unit-4-game/

In this game, there are 4 characters: Obi, Maul, Skywalker, and Sidious. The game starts by letting the user choose a character. When a character is chosen, that chosen character remains in its current row and the rest of the characters are position in the "Pick an enemy to attack" row. When the user chooses an enemy to attack, that enemy is sent to the "Fight Section." Then the user clicks the Attack button to fight the chosen enemy. When the user attacks, the enemy counter-attacks. But here's the catch: your attack power increases after every attack while your enemy's attack power remains the same. I have set up the game in such a way that it is possible for each character to win or to lose depending on the order of enemies the user chooses to fight. Good luck! 

The styling was accomplished using HTML5 and CSS3. DOM manipulation was accomplished using jQuery. Game logic used JavaScript (ES6).
